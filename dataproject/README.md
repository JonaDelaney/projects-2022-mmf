# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "Employment level" and is about looking for a correlation between employment level and economic variables as GDP and stock prices.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. SNA_TABLE1_17042022034132194.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=60702*) 
1. PDBI_I4_16042022200327428.csv (*https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=60702*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
